# flask-react-node-skeleton
Skeleton of a flask app with react that works by simply using browserify.

I am from the Python world and spend a few hours trying to setup React and a node toolchain. The code here is not strictly usable, but the hello world of both Flask and React work just fine.

Install everything by using npm on the package.json

Before you run the code you have to use Browserify command: browserify main.js -o bundle.js

The Flask server will run and be pretty useless without code, but a normal `python server.py` works fine for that
